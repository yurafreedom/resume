							.our-block__content
								p After we had been preparing and hiring employees for various companies around the world for several years, we noticed a big problem. Often, talented candidates were not noticed only by the fact that they did not use the mechanisms and skills that are required for the proper presentation of their skills. Moreover, most simply have neither the time nor the experience to do so. We wanted to give people the opportunity to get a suitable and really working resume in conjunction with the cover letter.
								p To do this, we have assembled a highly productive team of professionals consisting of HR-managers, executive recruiters, marketing and copywriting experts who have one goal: to show the candidate as a leader in the industry. It was at this moment that our company was born (instead of our company, then we put the name). From now on, we help people find the job they dream of in a modern, high-tech (digital), ever-changing job market.

								h2 A few reasons why you should approach the issue of writing a resume from a professional point of view:
							.reasons-block__content-block
								.reasons-block__content-article
									h3 Competition
									p Nowadays, it’s not enough just to apply for a “good” resume in order to get a job. The competition is very high and you MUST SELECT YOURSELF AMONG OTHERS. It is customary to say that in order for you to be noticed, your resume should be in the top 5%, but in practice it should be in the top 2%. Especially when you are applying for the DESIRED job, the code hundreds of people will send an application. And some of them may be more qualified than you.
								.reasons-block__content-article
									h3 Accent
									p No matter how smart you are, what position you are in or how much you want a new job. There is no doubt that you have accumulated enough experience and skills while working or studying in order to be an expert in your industry, but it’s very difficult to write a decent resume that will produce results. In addition, most are too busy to spend days writing
								.reasons-block__content-article
									h3 Competence
									p To write a resume that would pass this “cruel” selection requires special skills and years of accumulated experience. In our service (name) we have collected everything that is needed to give an impetus to your career and raise it to new heights, overcoming every single tier of the screening process.

										p The following two resume template  include a heat map of a recruiter’s eye movements by the results of a scientific study called “eye tracking”. This study was conducted by Will Evans, Head of User Experience at The Ladders, a well-respected job search engine. As Mr. Evans explains, the document on the right was examined more thoroughly than the one on the left because of its clear and concise format. Did you know that, according to recent studies, employers spend no more than 6 seconds screening a resume? With such critical time constraints, job seekers must make it easier for recruiters to find pertinent information by creating a resume with a clear and visual hierarchy. With our ultra-potent resumes and CVs, we GUARANTEE that you will stand out from the crowd and catch the attention of a future employer; finally securing that job you truly deserve.
